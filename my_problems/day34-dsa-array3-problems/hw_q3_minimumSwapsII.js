/**
 * Problem Description

Given an array of integers A of size N that is a permutation of [0, 1, 2, â€¦, (N-1)]. It is allowed to swap any two elements (not necessarily consecutive).
Find the minimum number of swaps required to sort the array in ascending order.

Problem Constraints
1 <= N <= 100000
0 <= A[i] < N

Input Format
The only argument given is the integer array A.

Output Format
Return the minimum number of swaps.

Example Input
Input 1:
A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 0]
Input 2:
A = [2, 0, 1, 3]

Example Output
Output 1:
4
Output 2:
2

Example Explanation
Explanation 1:
 If you swap (1, 2) -> (2, 3) -> (4, 0) -> (3, 0). You will get a sorted array.
 You cannot sort it with lesser swaps.
Explanation 2:
 You cannot sort it with lesser than 2 swaps.
