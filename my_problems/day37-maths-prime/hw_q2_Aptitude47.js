 * If two dice are thrown, what is the probability that the sum of the two dice will be a prime number?
 */

/* Solution:

    max sum = 12
    min sum = 2

    prime numbers from 1 to 12 are [2, 3, 5, 7, 11]

    all combinations => 
    1+1
    1+2 and 2+1
    1+4 and 4+1
    1+6 and 6+1
    2+3 and 3+2
    2+5 and 5+2
    3+4 and 4+3
    5+6 and 6+5

    total 15 out of 26 combination = 15/36 = 5/12
