/**
 Q1. Articulation Points
 Problem Description
 Given an undirected graph having A nodes. A matrix B of size M x 2 is given which represents the M edges such that there is a edge between node B[i][0] and node B[i][1].
 <p>
 You have to find all the Articulation Points in the graph.
 <p>
 A vertex in an undirected connected graph is an articulation point iff removing it (and edges through it) disconnects the graph.
 <p>
 For a disconnected undirected graph, an articulation point is a vertex removing which increases number of connected components.
 <p>
 Return an one-dimensional array which contains all the Articulation Points .
 <p>
 You can return the Articulation points in any order.
 <p>
 NOTE:
 <p>
 There are no self-loops in the graph.
 There are no multiple edges between two nodes.
 The graph may or may not be connected.
 Nodes are numbered from 1 to A.
 Your solution will run on multiple test cases. If you are using global variables make sure to clear them.
 <p>
 <p>
 Problem Constraints
 1 <= A, M <= 3Ã—105
 <p>
 1 <= B[i][0], B[i][1] <= A
 <p>
 <p>
 <p>
 Input Format
 The first argument given is an integer A representing the number of nodes in the graph.
 <p>
 The second argument given is an matrix B of size M x 2 which represents the M edges such that there is a edge between node B[i][0] and node B[i][1].
 <p>
 <p>
 <p>
 Output Format
 Return an one-dimensional array which contains all the Articulation Points .
 <p>
 <p>
 <p>
 Example Input
 Input 1:
 <p>
 A = 5
 B = [  [1, 2]
 [4, 1]
 [2, 4]
 [3, 4]
 [5, 2]
 [3, 1] ]
 Input 2:
 <p>
 A = 5
 B = [  [1, 2]
 [2, 3]
 [3, 4]
 [4, 5] ]
 <p>
 <p>
 Example Output
 Output 1:
 <p>
 [2]
 Output 2:
 <p>
 [2, 3, 4]
 <p>
 <p>
 Example Explanation:

 Explanation 1:
 <p>
 Node 2 is the only articulation point in the graph as removing it graphs breaks down into two
 component one which contains nodes [5] and another with [1, 3, 4].
 Explanation 2:
 <p>
 <p>
 Node 2 is an articulation point in the graph as removing it graphs breaks down into two component,
 one which contains nodes [1] and another with [3, 4, 5].
 Node 3 is an articulation point in the graph as removing it graphs breaks down into two component,
 one which contains nodes [1, 2] and another with [4, 5].
 Node 4 is an articulation point in the graph as removing it graphs breaks down into two component,
 one which contains nodes [1, 2, 3] and another with [5].
